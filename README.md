  Tic-Tac-Toe, also known as Noughts and crosses or Xs and Os. The game starts with empty cells and ends when someone wins or there is a draw.

  The bottom left cell has the coordinates (1, 1) and the top right cell has the coordinates (3, 3) like in this table:

  (1, 3) (2, 3) (3, 3)
  
  (1, 2) (2, 2) (3, 2)
  
  (1, 1) (2, 1) (3, 1)
  
  Program outputs 3x3 field with cells before the user's move, then ask the user about his next move, then the user should input 2 numbers that represent the cell on which user wants to make his X or O. Then program outputs the table including the user's most recent move.
